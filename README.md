## 🔒 Security Architecture

CourseSmith ENTERPRISE implements a **Session Token** system for anti-tamper protection:

1. When the license is validated, a unique session token is generated
2. The `ai_worker` and `pdf_engine` modules require this token to function
3. If the license gate is bypassed, these core modules will fail without a valid token

This ensures the software cannot be used without proper license activation.

## 📄 Output

The generated PDF includes:
- Professional cover page with AI-generated image
- Branded headers with optional logo
- Footers with page numbers and website URL
- Clean Helvetica typography
- Automatic markdown formatting (headers, bold, italic)
- Page breaks between chapters

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **GUI**: customtkinter (Dark Mode)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4o (content) + DALL-E 3 (images)
- **PDF**: ReportLab Platypus engine
- **Security**: SHA256-based license validation with session tokens

## 📝 License

This software is proprietary. A valid license key is required for use.
